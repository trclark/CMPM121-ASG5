# CMPM121-ASG5
Practice with animations and particle affects

I had a lot of trouble starting this project between RA duties and deadlines in our 171 game.  I hope to get an extension until tomorrow from Professor Mark Gerow.  I am sorry this project is in the state that it is in.  right now I have this and a spinning pick up object and thats it.  I should only get 2 points in the state that it is in.  This does not represent the work that I can do and I hope I get another chance.
